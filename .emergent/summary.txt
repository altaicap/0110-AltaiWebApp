The AI engineer primarily focused on a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the Altai Trader application, iteratively addressing user feedback. Initial tasks involved fixing a missing  for Archive functionality and implementing a document+gear icon. This quickly evolved into a prolonged battle with CSS specificity and theme compatibility across dark and light modes, particularly for button icons (Backtest & Configure, New Strategy, Save Configuration) and selected tab indicators. Multiple attempts with CSS classes, inline styles, and  declarations often failed, requiring troubleshooting (including calling  for React inline style issues) and repeated adjustments of / properties for SVG icons. A new Strategy Equity Curve pane was added, followed by significant refactoring of modal components (authentication, watchlist entry/settings) to address styling, alignment, and dynamic content (watchlist columns). Persistent issues revolved around dropdown styling (removing individual containers), calendar conditional formatting, and ensuring consistent icon/text colors across themes, highlighting the complexity of deep UI customization. The engineer frequently encountered false positives from automated testing, necessitating repeated manual user validation.

The objective is a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul for the Altai Trader platform, integrating dark (Laravel Nightwatch) and light (Cloud) themes. Key features include a redesigned 2x3 dashboard grid comprising:
-   **Trading Performance Highlights**: Win Rate, Profit Factor, Avg. Win/Loss with currency toggle and dynamic visual bars.
-   **Equity Curve**: Benchmark input, percentage display.
-   **Positions**: Extended columns, conditional formatting, horizontal scroll, strategy input, column management.
-   **Recently Closed**: Renamed, no chart, extended columns, R-Return column (right of $ PnL).
-   **Recent Entries**: Renamed, extended columns.
-   **Daily Net Cumulative PnL**: Charts only, $/R toggle.
-   **Tradezella-style Calendar**: Monday-first, daily PnL, view modes, individual day containers colored (green/orange/red) with white text.
Additional requirements include consistent spacing, dynamic pane controls, button color/icon fixes (e.g., signature dark green for Backtest & Configure buttons, specific icon colors for light/dark themes), font size adjustments, removal of redundant UI elements (Configure Required, Export Backtest), fixing dark theme text visibility for various dropdowns (Start Date, End Date, RVOL news, Timeframe), unifying Backtest Trade Log column management with Positions pane, adding an L/S column (Long/Short text, left-aligned) to Positions, Recently Closed, and Recent Entries panes, fixing Connection Statuses counter (e.g., 3/9), refining dropdown styles to remove individual containers, fixing font size dropdown alignment, addressing date picker transparency and styling (opaque, white header in dark theme, no grey borders, all dates visible), fixing win rate progress bars, and removing a grey background from the sun icon.
Further requirements included adding a **Strategy Equity Curve** pane with a line chart, percentage-based performance, and benchmark comparison. A new **Watchlist** tab was also added, featuring dynamic columns (Date, Ticker, Comments 1-6), editable entries, and a settings modal for column configuration (text input vs. dropdown with custom options), along with add/delete column functionality with undo on cancel.

The AI engineer has been focusing on refining the UI/UX, particularly addressing persistent styling inconsistencies. Most recently, the engineer worked on the Watchlist settings modal to ensure the Delete Column icon appears red and that the Field Type dropdown options do not have individual containers.

Specifically:
1.  **Red Delete Column Icon**: The  icon for Delete Column was updated to display as red by directly applying inline  and  CSS properties (, ). This change has been confirmed by the user as fixed.
2.  **Field Type Dropdown Styling**: Attempts were made to fix the Field Type dropdown in the Watchlist settings modal, where individual options still appeared with their own containers. The engineer added a specific class  to the  component in  and added corresponding CSS rules in  with high specificity. However, this attempt was reported by the user as *still not working*, indicating that the individual containers persist.

The immediate preceding conversation indicates the engineer's frustration with this recurring dropdown issue and a decision to re-evaluate by directly copying a previously successful pattern for dropdown styling.
