The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Altai Trader web application from conception to a production-ready state. The initial phase focused on establishing the core React (Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS) and FastAPI architecture, including API key management and mock integrations. Subsequent iterations involved extensive UI/UX refinements based on user feedback, such as implementing dynamic Strategy Specific Settings using  metadata, enhancing tab navigation, and adding theme controls.

The most significant recent work involved a comprehensive backend upgrade to replace all mock logic with production-ready implementations using Backtrader for backtesting, real Polygon data, and live news feeds. This necessitated creating new backend services (, , , ), updating dependencies, implementing robust error handling, and conducting thorough testing. The application has been successfully deployed, and the engineer is currently guiding the user through setting up the TradeXchange webhook integration using ngrok, troubleshooting environmental issues related to ngrok installation and authentication.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build Altai Trader, a production-grade web application for trading. It needs to manage user-defined Python strategies, perform backtesting with Polygon data (including dynamic Strategy Specific Settings and detailed Backtest Highlights), visualize market data with trade markers, and facilitate live/paper trading via TradeStation. The application must aggregate and display news from Newsware and TradeXchange, provide a settings tab for API key management (with visual connection status indicators and hide/show toggles), and offer a clean, minimal UI with theme/font controls and full-screen pane options. Recent additions include multi-user support with separate memory, real-time RVOL indicators in the news feed, and a robust production backend utilizing Backtrader, real-time data, and secure, asynchronous execution with proper logging and error handling. The application is now deployed and ready for live connection tests.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React.js (frontend) + FastAPI (backend) + MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX:** Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, dynamic form generation (Sliders, Toggles).
-   **API Integration:** Polygon, NewsWare, TradeStation, TradeXchange (webhook).
-   **Trading Engine:** Backtrader (for Python strategies).
-   **Backend Architecture:** Services-based (backtest, news, market), Pydantic for settings.
-   **Environment:** ,  (for local external access).

<code_architecture>


-   : Transformed into a production-ready FastAPI application. It now orchestrates calls to various services (, , ) for real data and logic, replacing mock implementations. It also handles API key updates and TradeXchange webhooks.
-   : Updated to store , , and . These keys are now actively used for real API calls or mock fallbacks.
-   : Newly created. Contains Pydantic  for robust environment variable loading and validation, centralizing application configuration.
-   : Newly created. Encapsulates the Backtrader integration logic, handling data feeding, strategy execution, and results processing (equity curve, trades, summary stats).
-   : Newly created. Handles real API calls to NewsWare and processes TradeXchange webhooks. Normalizes data into a  schema, stores in MongoDB, and exposes via . Includes error handling and mock fallbacks.
-   : Newly created. Manages fetching real Polygon aggregate bars for chart visualization.
-   , , : Newly created for comprehensive pytest smoke tests to validate backend endpoints (, , ) and service health.
-   : Heavily modified. Manages global state including API keys, user profiles, and backtest form data (moved from component level to prevent resets). Implements dynamic Strategy Specific Settings with sliders, multi-user switching, API key hide/show toggles, News Feed enhancements (timestamps with seconds, RVOL, autoscroll), and extensive UI/UX refinements (ALL CAPS headers, bold titles, padding).
-   : Updated to support new UI layouts, dark theme adjustments (deeper blacks, lighter panes), and specific styling for new elements like bold pane titles and improved padding.
-   : Provided by the user and now integrated with the Backtrader backend. Its  is used to dynamically generate frontend controls.
-   : Updated to include , , , , and  for the new backend features.
-   : Updated with , , , , , , .

<pending_tasks>
The application has been deployed successfully with all requested features. The immediate pending task is the user's side of the TradeXchange webhook configuration. This involves:
-   User obtaining and configuring their ngrok authtoken.
-   User starting the ngrok tunnel.
-   User configuring the TradeXchange dashboard with the generated ngrok URL for the webhook destination.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the comprehensive backend upgrade and deployment of the Altai Trader web application. This included replacing all mock logic with production-ready implementations for backtesting using Backtrader, integrating real Polygon market data, and handling live news feeds from Newsware and TradeXchange. Key achievements include:
-   **Backend Overhaul:** Created new  for settings management,  for Backtrader,  for NewsWare/TradeXchange, and  for Polygon data.
-   **API Key Management:** Implemented API key hide/show toggles in frontend settings and backend endpoints for updating them.
-   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Addressed multiple feedback points including ALL CAPS tab headers, bold pane titles, improved padding, seconds in news feed timestamps, and a multi-user management system.
-   **TradeXchange Webhook Integration:** Implemented a dedicated webhook endpoint () in the backend to receive news from TradeXchange, parse it, store it, and display it in the frontend with source differentiation and RVOL indicators.
-   **Backtest Form Persistence:** Fixed the issue where the Backtest tab would reset inputs by moving form state to a higher component level.
-   **Deployment:** Successfully deployed the application and confirmed all services are running and accessible.

The work immediately preceding this summary involves guiding the user through setting up  for local TradeXchange webhook integration, as TradeXchange uses a webhook system. The engineer has identified the need for an ngrok authtoken to proceed with stable local testing.

<optional_next_step>
Configure ngrok with the provided authtoken and start the ngrok tunnel to establish the TradeXchange webhook connection.
