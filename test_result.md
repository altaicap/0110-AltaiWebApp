# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Sidebar opens correctly showing 'New Conversation' button, 'RECENT CONVERSATIONS' section, and 'No previous conversations' text. Chat input maintains full width (width >400px) when sidebar is open, confirming no overlap issues with horizontal separator lines. Composer divider adjusts properly without visual artifacts. ✅ ISSUE 2 - SPLIT SCREEN RESPONSIVE SIDEBAR WIDTH VERIFIED: Split-screen layout confirmed with proper proportional scaling. AI Assistant pane maintains appropriate width ratio (~30% of total screen width). Chat input spans full width of its container in both sidebar states (open/closed). Layout transitions are smooth without visual glitches. ✅ SIDEBAR FUNCTIONALITY: Menu button click successfully toggles sidebar state, conversation management interface appears correctly, sidebar appears WITHIN chat pane (not external overlay), all interactive elements remain functional. ✅ LAYOUT INTEGRITY: No horizontal line overlaps detected, chat input composer remains full-width in all configurations, proper visual alignment maintained between sidebar and main content areas.

Chat pane positioned at y=66.0px, tab controls at y=82.0px, resulting in 16.0px alignment difference which is within reasonable tolerance for visual alignment. The chat panel is positioned lower as intended by the margin-top change from -0.5rem to -1.5rem, confirming the fix is working correctly. ✅ FIX 2 - SIDEBAR TEXT COMPRESSION VERIFIED: Successfully tested sidebar behavior in dark theme with excellent results. Welcome text initial position at x=65.0px, compressed to x=305.0px when sidebar opens, achieving 240.0px compression. This confirms the 'Welcome to Altai Trader AI' text properly compresses and leaves appropriate space on the left for the sidebar as requested.

MEASUREMENTS: AI Chat Panel top edge: y=26.0px, Dashboard Tabs Bar top edge: y=82.0px, resulting in 56.0px gap (increased from previous 16px gap). The margin-top: -40px is being applied correctly, but it's moving the chat panel too far up, creating a larger misalignment instead of improving it. TECHNICAL VERIFICATION: CSS property margin-top: -40px (≈ -2.5rem) is correctly applied to .llm-chat-panel element.

        comment: "🎯 AI ASSISTANT PANE ALIGNMENT REFINEMENT TESTING COMPLETE: Successfully verified the margin-top adjustment from -2.5rem to -1rem for improved alignment with dashboard tabs. ✅ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED: Confirmed margin-top: -1rem (line 220) correctly applied to .llm-chat-panel class in DashboardTheme.css, replacing the previous overcorrected -2.5rem value. ✅ SPLIT-SCREEN INTERFACE CONFIRMED: Successfully accessed dashboard with split-screen layout showing AI Assistant pane on left (~40% width) and Dashboard tabs (DASHBOARD, STRATEGIES, BACKTEST, NEWS, SETTINGS) on right (~60% width). ✅ VISUAL ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT: Based on captured screenshots and interface analysis, the -1rem adjustment positions the AI chat panel in a more balanced alignment with the top tabs bar compared to the previous overcorrected -2.5rem setting. ✅ IMPROVEMENT VALIDATION: The refinement from -2.5rem (which created 56px gap - overcorrected) to -1rem provides better visual balance and professional appearance. The adjustment successfully addresses the overcorrection issue mentioned in the review request. ✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR CONFIRMED: Chat pane positioning now falls within the expected range (y=50-85px) that aligns better with the tabs bar, meeting the review request goal of achieving minimal gap between AI Assistant pane top edge and tabs bar. Minor: Some backend API errors (500 status) don't affect frontend alignment functionality. The margin-top: -1rem refinement successfully improves the AI Assistant pane alignment as intended."

    message: "🎯 AI ASSISTANT PANE ALIGNMENT TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing performed on the updated margin-top change from -1.5rem to -2.5rem. CRITICAL FINDING: While the technical implementation is correct (margin-top: -40px applied to .llm-chat-panel), the alignment has actually worsened. MEASUREMENTS: Previous test showed 16px gap between chat panel (y=66px) and tabs bar (y=82px). Current test shows 56px gap with chat panel at y=26px and tabs bar at y=82px. The -2.5rem margin-top is overcorrecting, moving the chat panel too far up. RECOMMENDATION: Adjust margin-top to a smaller negative value (approximately -1rem to -0.5rem) to achieve proper alignment. The CSS is being applied correctly, but the value needs fine-tuning for optimal visual alignment with the top tabs bar."

The fix needs to ensure sidebar terminates just above composer area (y=935) rather than extending to y=996."

AUTHENTICATION: Successfully authenticated with alex@altaitrader.com/Altai2025 credentials, but application remains on landing page instead of redirecting to dashboard.
