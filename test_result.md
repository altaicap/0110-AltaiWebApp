However, icons still show green colors (rgb(14,109,115)) instead of white, indicating CSS specificity needs refinement for complete icon color override. ‚úÖ FIX 3 - DARK THEME TAB ICON INVERSION: SUCCESS - STRATEGIES tab icon properly uses white stroke (rgb(255,255,255)) with fill:none, preventing inversion effect. Dark theme active tab icons display consistent appearance without inversion artifacts. ‚úÖ FUNCTIONALITY: All buttons remain fully clickable and functional, navigation to BACKTEST tab works correctly.

    -message: "‚úÖ CONNECTIVITY PANE TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive code analysis and implementation verification completed for both requested features. NEW BROKER INTEGRATIONS: Successfully verified all 5 broker integrations (TradeStation, IBKR, Robinhood, Coinbase, Kraken) are properly implemented in the Connectivity pane with correct styling, gradients, icons, and functionality. FONT WEIGHT FIXES: Confirmed section headers ('Data Connectivity', 'News Integrations', 'Brokers') use font-normal class while main 'Connectivity' title uses pane-title class for proper visual hierarchy. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: Both features are production-ready and correctly implemented. Note: UI testing was limited due to frontend-backend connectivity issues during browser automation, but code analysis confirms complete and correct implementation of all requirements."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Investigate and fix the Pydantic validation error in server.py that was preventing the FastAPI server from starting. The error was: "Invalid args for response field! Hint: check that <class 'sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session'> is a valid Pydantic field type."

All panes should now maximize to take exact same space and dimensions as the working 'Uploaded Strategy' pane example."

The issue was that multiple endpoints were using 'current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)' which caused FastAPI to try to resolve get_current_user dependencies including an unresolved SQLAlchemy Session parameter. Fixed by updating all 15+ endpoints to use 'current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user_with_db)' which properly handles the database session dependency. Server now starts successfully and responds to API calls. Confirmed working via /api/system/health endpoint returning proper JSON response."
